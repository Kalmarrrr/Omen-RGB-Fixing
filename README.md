Like everyone else who has changed the motherboard on their Omen PC, my RGB controller failed. So I tried to figure out how to get the RGB to work again. 
This allows you to control the lighting module via USB connected to any motherboard.
The Omen 30L and older Omen desktops, which use a similar module, will also work. 
Im not much of a Linux guy, but it should work on them too.
Just run py -3 -m pip install pywinusb and use this code.
